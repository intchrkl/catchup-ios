# CatchUp

**CatchUp** is a social iOS app designed to help friends stay connected through thoughtful daily prompts. Instead of endless scrolling, CatchUp encourages lightweight, intentional check-ins that turn into meaningful conversations over time.

Users answer short daily questions, view friends’ responses in a fast, vertical feed, and engage through reactions and comments. Streaks and smart notifications promote consistency without pressure.
